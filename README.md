Dear shiny spp user and peer-reviewer


Thirst of all thanks for assessing my work!

The app calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) which is a measure of weight and height.

The use of the shiny app is very easy. Once you started the app in RStudio it appears in your browser as an html5 application. 

You have to enter your weight (in kg) and height (in cm). You can either fill in the values by the computer keyboard or by clicking with your mouse on the up/down buttons on the right side of the entry fields. 

Press the "submit" button to calculate your BMI. On the right side below the BMI output you can check in which BMI-category you fall. 


Best,
Tobias
